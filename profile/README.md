## Welcome to the VoiceDeck GitHub repository. 👋
VoiceDeck is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize journalism funding by leveraging the concept of retroactive funding. Our mission is to empower citizen journalism with transparent funding mechanisms, enabling supporters to back impactful reporting that fosters community growth and accountability.

You can learn more about our mission at: https://voicedeck.org/our-mission/

## Project Overview
VoiceDeck aims to create a decentralized ecosystem where journalism is supported not just before or during the reporting process but after its impact has been felt and verified. We believe that this approach will encourage in-depth, quality journalism and allow journalists to be funded based on the tangible change their work creates within communities.

In this project, we will use Hypercerts to mint the impact reports. Anon aadhaar for KYC & Sybil resistant.
